Converts DragonShield scanner's export CSV to usable mass import .txt file for deckbuilding websites.

To use add `input.csv` in the same folder as `extractor.py` and run `python extractor.py`. It should generate `output.txt` with your collection's mass import text file.

Options:
- `--path`: Optionally, you can pass in relative or full path to your CSV file (the default option is set to `./input.csv`)
